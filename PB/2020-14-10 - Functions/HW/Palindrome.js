# Palindrome Challenge

What is Palindrome?

"A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam, racecar."-- Wikipedia

PROBLEM: 
1- Write a function that controls whether its argument is a palindrome (return true) or not (return false).
2- Rewrite the function with function expression.
3- Instead of the argument variable, use rewrite your function (and expression) with a global variable.
